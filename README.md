# RADAR-target-generation-and-detection
In this project, an FMCW RADAR is configured. The transmit and recieved signals are processed uisng FFT and CFAR to determine the range and velocity of the target"

## Project overview

The above picture outlines the project pipeline.

The initial range and velocity of the target are set to be: 
* R = 120 meters
* V = -20 meters/sec

The bandwidth, chirp time and slope of the chirp signal are calculated according to the following formulas

where Rmax is the maximum range of the RADAR and c is the speed of light.

## Modeling signal propogation for moving target scenario

The transmission and recieved signals are charecterised by the following equations.

The beat signal is computed as product of transmission and recieved signal. The result is charecterised by the following equation:

## FFT: Range estimation
A 1D FFT is implimented on the best signal to estimate the range of the target. 

FFT implimentation: 
* The beat signal is reshaped in to a 2D vector of size (Nr, Nd). where, Nr is the sampling frequency per chirp and Nd is the total number of a chirps in a chirp sequence. 
* FFT is ran on the beat signal along the range bins dimension (Nr)
* The output of the FFT is normalized
* Since the second halt of the output is a mirror image of the first half, only the first half of the image is retained. 
* The output is plotted 
* The peak rightly estimates the range of the target as follows:

## Range Doppler Map (RDM)

The Range Doppler map is generated by running a 2D FFT on the reshped beat signal. The implimentation is as follows: 
* A 2D FFT is ran over the beat signal of dimension (Nr, Nd)
* Only the first half of the output, in range dimension, is retained. 
* The absolute value of the RDM is comupted and the logarithmic values of it are computed. 
* The resulting RDM is visualized as follows:

From  the above image it can be observed that the map has significant amount of noise. A constant thrushold factor to detect peaks can potentially lead to high rate of false alarms. In order to signifantly overcome this problem, a Continuous False Alarm Rate filter is applied to RDM as shown in the next section

## Continous False Alarm Rate (CFAR)
A 2D CFAR filter, that suppresses the noise and computes a dynamic threshold to maintain a constant false alarm rate is implemented as follows: 
* A filter of following configuratin is considered:

* The number of training cells and guard cells are iteratively determined. 
* The filter is slid over the complete RDM. 
* The mean of all the training cells around each cell of interest is computed. This mean is considered as the initial threshold.
* An offset (Iteratively fine-tuned) is added to the threshold in the previous step, resulting the final threshold.
* Thus a vector of thresholds for each cell of interest is computed. 
* The RDM is filtered according to the latest, dynamic, threhsold values. This results in the folliwing map, which contains only the valid target signal:

## Conclusion
Thus a pipeline is built to:
* Confugre an FMCW RADAR
* Generate transmission and recieving signal
* Esitmate the range of the target 
* Generate Range Doppler Map (RDM)
* Filter RDM through CFAR and determine the range and velocity of the object with high certainity
